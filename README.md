# TennisPal

## Overview

TennisPal is a platform for tennis players who are looking for people to play with 
or to find free courts in the greater Toronto area. Integrating the Google Maps API 
makes it easier to see the location of a tennis court, and using the Socket.IO 
library allows for real-time communication between users.

Built with Javscript, React.js, Socket.IO, Node.js, Express.js, Mongo.DB, Multer

## Difficulties

Problems I encountered was figuring out how to use multer to upload files for the user
profile picture, as well as socket.io to allow for real-time chat between users. I 
required assistance and found a mentor to help me solve these issues.
